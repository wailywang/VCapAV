The folder contains the VAE encoder and the VAE decoder used in the paper `Using a manifold vocoder for spectral voice and style conversion` . The encoder and decoder was trained on the multi-speaker TIMIT database.



We also provide the samples for the samples of the three experiments in the paper: vocoding evaluation (`samples/VOD`), voice conversion evaluation (` samples/{F2F, F2M, M2F, M2M}`), and style conversion evaluation (`samples/SC`).



`F2F` stands for female-to-female mapping; `F2M` stands for female-to-male mapping; `M2F` stands for male-to-female mapping; `M2M` stands for male-to-male mapping. The file name has a format of `srcSpeaker-trgSpeaker_sentID_mappingFeat.wav`.
